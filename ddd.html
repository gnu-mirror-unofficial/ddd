<UL>
<LI>
<STRONG>(2008/04/30) New maintainer found: Jose Maria Gomes Vergara.
</STRONG>
More updates soon.

<LI><STRONG>(2008/03/03) Seeking a new maintainer.
</STRONG>
We are officially looking for a new person to take over as maintainer of DDD.
When I (Andrew) began doing it back in 2003, my day-job permitted me to spend a
percentage of time on it.  That's no longer the case.  As you can see, it's
been over two years since the last release, and I'm worried that DDD is
suffering from this lack of attention.  So if you feel you are sufficiently (a)
dedicated and (b) qualified to take over as maintainer, please let me know.
Two possible projects might be of interest:
	<UL>
	<LI>
	Add in functionality to display C++ standard containers (std::vector,
	std::map, <i>et al</i>).  This is likely to require work on gdb too.
	<LI>
	Move the DDD codebase to a modern widget-set.  Motif is quite
	labour-intensive, which makes it unnecessarily hard to fix bugs and add
	new features.  The fact that it's C-based means is isn't a good fit
	when the rest of the code-base is C++.  It also doesn't match modern
	desktop environments.  Using a modern toolkit such at gtkmm would
	be a great improvement to DDD.  The work involved in this transition is
	not to be underestimated.  DDD is a rich GUI app, and there is no clean
	separation of logic between the UI and the rest of the code.
	</UL>
And of course, there's the usual stream (trickle, actually) of bug fixes to
deal with.  I estimate that you'll need to spend about 3 hours per week on
bug-fixing and answering queries on the mailing list.  That'll increase if you
take on one of the challenges above (or one of your own, of course).

<LI>
<STRONG>(2005/10/16) The DDD mailing list is now for subscribers only.
</STRONG>
Since I took over from Andreas as the maintainer of DDD,
I've been trying to get admin access to the mailing list
server web interface, in order to make the list a subscriber-only
list.  In other words, only those subscribed to the list
can post messages to it.

I'm pleased to say that I've finally got help from the
system admins at gnu.org, who have granted me access.

So from now on, the DDD list will be a closed list.
Anyone who wishes to discuss DDD is welcome to subscribe.
Anyone who is a subscriber can post with no restrictions.

I regret that this can't be an open list any more, but
this is the spam-strewn world in which we live.


<LI>
<STRONG>(2005/03/16) DDD 3.3.11 is now <A HREF="#Getting">available</A>.
</STRONG> DDD-3.3.11 fixes a problem introduced in 3.3.10 which affected DBX
users.  It also features a fix that helps when using I18N encondings.

<LI>
<STRONG>(2004/10/20) DDD 3.3.10 is now <A HREF="#Getting">available</A>.
</STRONG> DDD-3.3.10 features many, many improvements to perl-5.8.x support.
It also provides fixes for Sun's SunONE Studio dbx, as well as some fixes
for MacOS X.

<LI>
<STRONG>(2004/06/24) DDD 3.3.9 is now <A HREF="#Getting">available</A>.
</STRONG> DDD-3.3.9 brings support for PHP; this is largely untested, so
feedback is most welcome.  Locating source files when using dbx now works
automatically.  The perl version supported by DDD is now 5.8.x; unfortunately
there remain a few wrinkles, but we're working on them.   The debugger settings
window now starts at a larger, more reasonable size, and allows the user to
resize it.  Several minor bugs have been fixed, memory leaks plugged, code
cleaned up, etc.  And lastly, builds on many platforms have been improved, both
with G++ 3.x and with various vendor compilers.  If you've had problems
building DDD on your platform (HPUX, Cygwin, Tru64, Solaris, Irix, AIX), then
this is the DDD version that's for you!

<LI>
<STRONG>(2003/11/10) DDD 3.3.8 is now <A HREF="#Getting">available</A>.
</STRONG> DDD 3.3.8 contains some important memory corruption fixes, and better
interoperation with gdb-5.x, gdb-6.0, and the Perl debugger.  In addition,
Arnaud Desitter has made literally hundreds of micro-optimisations throughout
the codebase.  Builds on HPUX-10.20 and NetBSD are improved too.  The manual is
now distributed in PS, PDF, and texinfo sources in the main distribution
tarball (previously, it was a separate bundle).  DDD 3.3.8 is the fastest and
most stable DDD yet -- I strongly recommend upgrading if you are using an
earlier version.

<LI>
<STRONG>(2003/07/31) DDD 3.3.7 is now <A HREF="#Getting">available</A>.
</STRONG> DDD 3.3.7 brings debugging of bash scripts (together with bashdb) and
improved conformity with ISO C++: in particular, G++-3.x is now the compiler
recommended for DDD. G++-2.x versions will definitely not work, and will no
longer be supported.

<LI>
<STRONG>(2003/05/15) Andreas Zeller has handed maintainership of DDD to Andrew
Gaylard.</STRONG>

<H2><A NAME="About">What is DDD?</A></H2>

GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as <A
HREF="/software/gdb/gdb.html">GDB</A>, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB,
the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, or the Python debugger.  Besides
``usual'' front-end features such as viewing source texts, DDD has become
famous through its interactive graphical data display, where data structures
are displayed as graphs.

<H2><A NAME="Alpha">Where do I get DDD alpha releases?</A></H2>

Recent (not necessarily tested) snapshots of GNU DDD can be
found at <SAMP><A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/</A></SAMP>.
<P>
The DDD CVS repository (containing all versions of DDD, including the
very latest changes) is available via
<SAMP><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddd/</A></SAMP>.



<H2><A NAME="Bugs">I have found a bug!  How do I report it?</A></H2>

You can report bugs to <SAMP><A
HREF="mailto:bug-ddd at gnu.org">bug-ddd at gnu.org</A></SAMP>.  Before you
do this, please check the following:
<UL>
<LI> Please read the section ``Bugs and How to Report Them'' toward
the end of the <A HREF="/manual/ddd/">DDD Manual</A>.

<LI> Be sure to include a copy of your <SAMP>~/.ddd/log</SAMP> file
which tells your DDD configuration as well as the interaction between
DDD and the underlying command-line debugger.
</UL>

<P>
The purpose of reporting a bug is to enable the bug to be fixed for
the sake of the whole community of users. You may or may not receive a
response; the maintainers will send one if that helps them find or
verify a fix. Most GNU maintainers are volunteers and all are
overworked; they don't have time to help individuals and still fix the
bugs and make the improvements that everyone wants. If you want help
for yourself in particular, you may have to <A
HREF="/help/gethelp.html">hire someone for technical support</A>.  

<P>

If you are willing to help fixing DDD bugs, you can 
<A HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-ddd/">subscribe
to the bug-ddd mailing list or access its archives</A>.



<H2><A NAME="Assistance">I have a question regarding DDD.  Where do I get assistance?</A></H2>

We have a general-purpose mailing list devoted to DDD.  You can ask
any questions to <SAMP><A
HREF="mailto:ddd at gnu.org">ddd at gnu.org</A></SAMP>.  Patches and new
releases are also announced here.  <A
HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/ddd">Subscription info and
mailing list archives</A> are available.  Owing to abuse by spammers,
it is necessary to subscribe before posting to the list.
