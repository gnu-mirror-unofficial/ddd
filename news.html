<strong>(2009/02/11) DDD 3.3.12 is now available from 
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ddd">ftp.gnu.org</a>.
</strong> DDD 3.3.12 features much improved support for debugging
Python, Bash and Make, as well as various bug fixes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2009/02/11) Release candidate 3.3.12-rc1 is available.</strong>
DDD can now be used effectively to debug Python, Bash and Makefiles.
You can grab the new release candidate from
<a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ddd">alpha.gnu.org</a>.  The source tarball
is signed with the maintainer's GPG public key, which you can download from
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist-gpgkeys.php?group=ddd">Savannah</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2008/10/22) DDD has a bug tracker on Savannah.</strong>
The <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=ddd">bug tracker</a>
is the best way to report bugs (use "Bugs" on the toolbar, and "Submit").
You are encouraged to login, but you can post bug anonymously if you want.
Posting directly to the <tt>bug-ddd</tt> mailing list is now deprecated, since the tracker
is a much more powerful way to organise the information. Please follow the
instructions for <a href="#Bugs">bug reporting</a>.

<strong>(2008/10/19) Jose Maria Gomez Vergara has handed
maintainership of DDD to Peter Wainwright.

<strong>(2008/06/10) CVS to Subversion conversion and move to
Savannah site.</strong> DDD is now completely on the GNU Savannah
site; the older SourceForge site is deprecated. Furthermore version
control of the source code is now handled via Subversion, although Web pages
like this one are maintained in CVS. For more details to how access it
please visit savannah web page for instructions.&nbsp;</li><li>To
report bugs you should use the bug track system in savannah as well.
All other emails to the generic distribution list with errors will be
ignored. Please, subscribe to DDD distribution list in order to be up
to date with all about this project.&nbsp;</li><li>This web page will
change in some days to make it more clear and
useful.</li>

<strong>(2008/05/06) New plans for DDD.
</strong>The new maintainer has communicated to the official DDD distribution list about the intention of change the GUI to a <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/" name="Qt">Qt</a>
based interface. At the end, it seems that what is going to happens is
that DDD will have two branches, one with a GUI based in Qt and other
based in Gtkmm, with a common core that will be independent of the GUI.
So, it will be possible putting any other GUI based in any other
library. As you know <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/appdev/licensing/licensing#qt-open-source-license" name="Qt is GPL v3">Qt is GPL v3</a> licensed.

<strong>(2008/04/30) New maintainer found: Jose Maria Gomez Vergara.
</strong>
If you want to know a little more about the new maintainer you can have a look to his profile in Linkedin. <p>Following the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) he has put here a link to his professional profile at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/josemariagomez">LinkedIn</a>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>(2008/03/03) Seeking a new maintainer.
</strong>
We are officially looking for a new person to take over as maintainer of DDD.
When I (Andrew) began doing it back in 2003, my day-job permitted me to spend a
percentage of time on it.  That's no longer the case.  As you can see, it's
been over two years since the last release, and I'm worried that DDD is
suffering from this lack of attention.  So if you feel you are sufficiently (a)
dedicated and (b) qualified to take over as maintainer, please let me know.
Two possible projects might be of interest:
<ul>
	<li>
	Add in functionality to display C++ standard containers (std::vector,
	std::map, <i>et al</i>).  This is likely to require work on gdb too.
	</li>
	<li>
	Move the DDD codebase to a modern widget-set.  Motif is quite
	labour-intensive, which makes it unnecessarily hard to fix bugs and add
	new features.  The fact that it's C-based means is isn't a good fit
	when the rest of the code-base is C++.  It also doesn't match modern
	desktop environments.  Using a modern toolkit such at gtkmm would
	be a great improvement to DDD.  The work involved in this transition is
	not to be underestimated.  DDD is a rich GUI app, and there is no clean
	separation of logic between the UI and the rest of the code.
   </li>
</ul>
And of course, there's the usual stream (trickle, actually) of bug fixes to
deal with.  I estimate that you'll need to spend about 3 hours per week on
bug-fixing and answering queries on the mailing list.  That'll increase if you
take on one of the challenges above (or one of your own, of course).
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2005/10/16) The DDD mailing list is now for subscribers only.
</strong>
Since I took over from Andreas as the maintainer of DDD,
I've been trying to get admin access to the mailing list
server web interface, in order to make the list a subscriber-only
list.  In other words, only those subscribed to the list
can post messages to it.

I'm pleased to say that I've finally got help from the
system admins at gnu.org, who have granted me access.

So from now on, the DDD list will be a closed list.
Anyone who wishes to discuss DDD is welcome to subscribe.
Anyone who is a subscriber can post with no restrictions.

I regret that this can't be an open list any more, but
this is the spam-strewn world in which we live.

<li>
<strong>(2005/03/16) DDD 3.3.11 is now <a href="#Getting">available</a>.
</strong> DDD-3.3.11 fixes a problem introduced in 3.3.10 which affected DBX
users.  It also features a fix that helps when using I18N encondings.
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2004/10/20) DDD 3.3.10 is now <a href="#Getting">available</a>.
</strong> DDD-3.3.10 features many, many improvements to perl-5.8.x support.
It also provides fixes for Sun's SunONE Studio dbx, as well as some fixes
for MacOS X.
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2004/06/24) DDD 3.3.9 is now <a href="#Getting">available</a>.
</strong> DDD-3.3.9 brings support for PHP; this is largely untested, so
feedback is most welcome.  Locating source files when using dbx now works
automatically.  The perl version supported by DDD is now 5.8.x; unfortunately
there remain a few wrinkles, but we're working on them.   The debugger settings
window now starts at a larger, more reasonable size, and allows the user to
resize it.  Several minor bugs have been fixed, memory leaks plugged, code
cleaned up, etc.  And lastly, builds on many platforms have been improved, both
with G++ 3.x and with various vendor compilers.  If you've had problems
building DDD on your platform (HPUX, Cygwin, Tru64, Solaris, Irix, AIX), then
this is the DDD version that's for you!
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2003/11/10) DDD 3.3.8 is now <a href="#Getting">available</a>.
</strong> DDD 3.3.8 contains some important memory corruption fixes, and better
interoperation with gdb-5.x, gdb-6.0, and the Perl debugger.  In addition,
Arnaud Desitter has made literally hundreds of micro-optimisations throughout
the codebase.  Builds on HPUX-10.20 and NetBSD are improved too.  The manual is
now distributed in PS, PDF, and texinfo sources in the main distribution
tarball (previously, it was a separate bundle).  DDD 3.3.8 is the fastest and
most stable DDD yet -- I strongly recommend upgrading if you are using an
earlier version.
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2003/07/31) DDD 3.3.7 is now <a href="#Getting">available</a>.
</strong> DDD 3.3.7 brings debugging of bash scripts (together with bashdb) and
improved conformity with ISO C++: in particular, G++-3.x is now the compiler
recommended for DDD. G++-2.x versions will definitely not work, and will no
longer be supported.
</li>
<li>
<strong>(2003/05/15) Andreas Zeller has handed maintainership of DDD to Andrew
Gaylard.</strong>
